Week 9 – TouchDesigner: This piece focuses on creating a smooth and satisfying color blend. Noise generates flowing textures, while displacement warps them for a dynamic effect. Edge detection outlines the movement, blur softens the result, and feedback creates trailing motion. Level adjusts contrast and brightness, and all elements are composited into a vibrant animation.

Week 10 – TouchDesigner: One of my favorites to watch, this piece feels almost hypnotic with black and beige constantly switching. A grid sets up the instance layout, and noise distorts the box shapes. Geometry holds the 3D objects, with camera and light creating the scene. A colorful texture is applied using MovieFileIn, and Displace uses that along with noise to deform the shapes. Render outputs the final result.

Week 11 – TouchDesigner: I had major trouble with this one during class but I’m proud of how much it improved. Geometry forms the shape, and audio-reactive controls make a circle respond to sound. SOP networks link everything together, controlling how the shape looks and behaves over time. While it’s not perfect, it’s definitely more listenable and visually engaging now.

Week 6 – p5.js:  This graph began as an exercise, aS I tried not following the tutorial video until i had no idea what to do next. Causing the graph to turn out different from what I expected. Surprisingly, this experiement led me to some of my favourite code experiments. I ended up teaching myself new things, and while the result isn’t a proper graph, it’s visually fun and engaging to watch.

Week 6 – p5.js:  During class, I created a spiral pattern using push and pop, to build its hypnotic movement. The repeated rotation and translation made a visually satisfying and pretty effect with the colours pink and purple, showing how simple transformations can result in complex designs.

Week 6 – p5.js:  This work was a practice exercise exploring noise and random colour generation. I applied these techniques to the shape circle, resulting in a colourful and random animation that showed how randomness can create art.
